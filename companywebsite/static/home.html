            Video editing software is software used[1] performing 
            the post-production video editing of digital video sequences 
            on a non-linear editing system (NLE). It has replaced traditional 
            flatbed celluloid film editing tools and analog video tape-to-tape online editing machines.

            Video editing is the manipulation and arrangement of video shots. 
            Video editing is used to structure and present all video information, 
            including films and television shows, video advertisements and video essays. 
            Video editing has been dramatically democratized in recent years by editing 
            software available for personal computers. Editing video can be difficult and 
            tedious, so several technologies have been produced to aid people in this task.
            Pen based video editing software was developed in order to give people a more 
            intuitive and fast way to edit video.
